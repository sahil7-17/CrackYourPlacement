NOTE : IT'S ALSO KNOWN AS MOORE'S VOTING ALGORITHM WHERE WE SELECT A CANDIDATE FIRST THEN WE SEARCH IT'S APPEARING N/2 TIME
to find the majority element we have to find the contender who maybe majority for this we make a res=0 var and a count =1var and iterate a loop from 1 to N and we check if  
arr[res]== arr[i]  then count ++
else 
count--
and if count gone to 0 then we set 
res = i;
count =1 ;
and after finishing the loop we got our contender  

class Solution {
public:
    int majorityElement(vector<int>& nums) {
        int  n = nums.size();
        int res = 0;
        int count = 1;
        for(int i = 1; i<n; i++){
           if(nums[res] == nums[i]){
            count++;
           }
           else{
            count--;
           }
           if(count == 0){
             res = i;
             count = 1;
           }
        }
         count = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i<n; i++){
            if(nums[i] == nums[res]){
                count++;
            }
            if(count > n/2){
                return nums[res];
            }
        }
        return -1;

    }
};
